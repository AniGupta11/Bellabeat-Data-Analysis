## 🚀 Project Phases

1. **Phase 1 – Data Collection & Understanding**  
   - Collected **18 CSV datasets** from STRAVA (smart device data).  
   - Explored data structure, features, and key metrics.  

2. **Phase 2 – Data Cleaning & Processing**  
   - Removed duplicates, handled missing values.  
   - Merged all CSVs into a single cleaned dataset (`bellabeat_clean.csv`).  

3. **Phase 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized activity levels, calories burned, sleep patterns, and daily intensity.  
   - Identified patterns in usage and correlations between activities.  

4. **Phase 4 – Insights & Recommendations**  
   - Derived insights into how users engage with Bellabeat’s products.  
   - Suggested **marketing and product improvements**.  

5. **Phase 5 – Reporting & Visualization**  
   - Created professional reports in **Power BI & Python**.  
   - Exported findings as **PDF deliverables**.

## 📊 Key Findings

- Many users track steps, calories, and activity daily but **sleep data is underutilized**.  
- Users with consistent activity patterns tend to have **better health outcomes**.  
- Engagement is higher during **weekdays compared to weekends**.  
- Marketing opportunities exist in promoting **sleep tracking and guided wellness features**.

## 📌 Recommendations

- Enhance **sleep tracking features** and promote them through targeted campaigns.  
- Introduce **personalized wellness recommendations** based on user activity.  
- Encourage **weekend activity challenges** to increase engagement.  
- Leverage **social/community features** to motivate users through group goals.
